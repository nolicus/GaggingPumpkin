# Gagging Pumpkin
Team 2

## Introduction

This pumpkin detects when a hand is inserted into the "mouth" and triggers a
sound effect from some internal speakers.

## Bill of Materials

You can modify the design according to your specific application. For our design
we used the folling parts.

## Additional Resources

- 3D Printer
- Soldering Equipment
- Pumpkin Carving Tools
- Ziplock Bag (to keep components dry)
- Computer (for Teensy Programming)
- Double-sided tape

## Instructions

1. Assemble Teensy and Commet breakout board. 
2. Add breakouts and headers for sensor, eye LEDs and MP3 player 
3. Print the Sensor loop with a 3D printer and embed the solid core twisted pair 
    wire during the printing process (we used ethernet cable).
4. Add connectors and cables between individual components.
5. Upload source code to Teensy.
6. Place audio files on SD Card. 
7. Drill holes in "Treeface Eyes" for LEDs
8. Cut hole for sensor in pumpkin and remove innards.* 
9. Use double-sided tape to attach face elements to the pumpkin


*Note: The sensor is sensitive to the pumpkin flesh. For ideal performance add a 2 inch gap between the outside of the sensor an the pumpkin flesh with a cardboard "gasket". Also using Coax cable and limiting the length of exposed twisted pair wire outside of the sensor ring will increase the performance of the sensor.
